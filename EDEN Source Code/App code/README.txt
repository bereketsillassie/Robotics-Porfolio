The EDEN mobile application is a plant monitoring and management system developed using React Native and Expo Router. It allows users to add planting information, monitor real-time NPK sensor data, and receive actionable notifications regarding plant health. The application uses a centralized plant database containing expected nutrient levels (in mg/kg) for a variety of plant types, enabling comparisons between live sensor readings and optimal conditions. It leverages the React Context API for global state management, ensuring consistent access to planting data across different screens. The app features a calendar interface for logging plantings, a notification center for displaying system alerts, and a modal system for easy data entry. Built with modern mobile development practices, EDEN offers a scalable and efficient solution for integrating sensor-driven plant care with an intuitive user interface.

# Robotics Portfolio

This repository collects selected robotics and automation projects Iâ€™ve worked on, ranging from autonomous navigation to plant care systems. The goal is to showcase different skills in controls, embedded systems, and software integration.

## Project Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Autonomous Robotics
- **Irrigation_Bot_GUI-RC_control** â€“ Early GUI/RC control interface for a mobile irrigation robot.  
- **Pi code files V2** â€“ Raspberry Piâ€“based robotics control stack with supporting configuration.

### ðŸ”¹ EDEN Source Code
IoT-based plant monitoring and automation system.  
- **App code (EdenApp2.0)** â€“ Android app built with Expo/React Native. Features live plant stats, notifications, and calendar.  
- **ESP32 Subsystem Control** â€“ Firmware for ESP32-based pods handling irrigation and sensor data.  
- **HMI Server code** â€“ Python/HTML server for plant data visualization.  

### ðŸ”¹ Micromouse
10x10 maze-solving robot with multiple navigation algorithms implemented on an ESP32 with encoder feedback and PD motor control.  
- **FloodFillV1** â€“ Classic flood fill pathfinding.  
- **A_starV1** â€“ A* search with Euclidean heuristic.  
- **DijkstrasV1** â€“ Uniform-cost search implementation.  
- **RDFSV1** â€“ Recursive DFS maze exploration.  

### ðŸ”¹ Other
- **3_phase_throttle_test_simple** â€“ Motor control test for a three-phase throttle setup.  
- **PID_line_follower** â€“ Line-following robot using QTR sensor array and PID speed control.
